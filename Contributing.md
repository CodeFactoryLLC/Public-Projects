# Contributing to CodeFactory Command Automation Packages 

### First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to CodeFactory and its open source community-driven automation packages, which are hosted in the [Public Projects](https://github.com/CodeFactoryLLC/Public-Projects) repo on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### CodeFactory and Community-authored Automation Packages 

While the CodeFactory RT client is a commercial product, a wide variety of open-source Automation Commands are publicly available for you to use, clone, modify, etc.  

Because CodeFactory is so extensible, it's possible that a feature you've become accustomed to or an issue you're encountering isn't coming from a bundled package at in this repository at all, but rather a community package you've installed. Each community package has its own repository too, the [Contributor FAQ] has instructions on how to contact the maintainers of any community package.

### Reporting Bugs 

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for open source content. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports. 

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list] as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster. 

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. 

### Before Submitting A Bug Report 

SECTION UNDER DEVELOPMENT 

Check the FAQs on the forum for a list of common questions and problems. 

Determine which repository the problem should be reported in. 

Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
