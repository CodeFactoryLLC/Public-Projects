# Public-Projects
A directory of community driven projects on GitHub that are utilizing CodeFactory SDK to author automation projects. 

# Community Aligned Automation Resources
We recognize that most of the best ideas for automation will come from the creator community. We want to encourage and recognize community-driven CodeFactory automation template authoring and share these resources with other CodeFactory users. If you are building an automation project using CodeFactory, please tag is with #codefactoryllc and we will include a link to your project in this directory.

(more coming soon... under construction)
