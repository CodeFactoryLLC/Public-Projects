# Public-Projects
A directory of community driven projects on GitHub that are utilizing CodeFactory SDK to author automation projects. 

# Community Aligned Automation Resources
We recognize that many creative ideas for automation will come from the creator community. We want to encourage and recognize community-driven CodeFactory automation template authoring and share these resources with other CodeFactory users. If you are building an automation project using CodeFactory, please tag is with #codefactoryllc and we will include a link to your project in this directory. Some examples of potential automation projects include: 

* Services/WCF to Rest 
* UI/ASPNet(.net Core 3x or .Net 5) to Blazor AOT 
* UI/Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4 
* UI/Bootstrap 4 to Material 
* UI/HTML to XAML Web 
* Architecture/MVC to MVVM (maybe.  Could be useful with the project above it to XAML) 
* Architecture/ASP.Net Add Logging 
* Architecture/XAML Add Logging 

Additionally there are several issues tagged with #HelpWanted if you want to jump in. Just post a comment in [any of these issues](https://github.com/CodeFactoryLLC/Public-Projects/issues) to get guidance on getting started from our team.

[HyperLLC](https://github.com/HyperLLC/DotNet5Commands)|UNDER CONSTRUCTION: "CodeFactory Commands" library that provides a reference implementation of automation for ASP.Net .Net 5 projects. You can use this commands library to automate the code generation of the initial plumbing code for your views, partial views, models, interfaces, and navigation structure within an .Net 5 ASP.NET MVC Web Application. The best thing about this concept is that all of your plumbing and project artifacts are generated the same way EVERY time!
